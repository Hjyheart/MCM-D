\section{Model Assumptions}
The model should be based on the six following assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Assumption 1:The passengers are slower than belongings: This is based on our life experience.
  \item Assumption 2:Develop two or more potential modifications to the current process to improve passenger throughput and reduce variance in wait time.
  \item Assumption 3:The number of passengers to the airport is 75000: We take Chicago O'Hare Airport as an example, and we find the passenger traffic in the related news.
  \item Assumption 4:The time required for the officer to perform security checks is normally distributed.
  \item Assumption 5:There is not any emergency event happened in airport.
  \item Assumption 6:Passengers with Pre-check qualification are all queued at the Pre-check lanes.
\end{itemize}

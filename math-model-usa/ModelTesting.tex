\section{Model Testing}
In order to further test the model we have established, we collected data from the Beijing Capital International Airport in China through actual investigation. According to the survey, 24 million people go into the Beijing International Airport every day. We put this data into our model. After simulation by computer, we come to the conclusion that the Beijing International Airport needs 72 sets of equipment and staff. In fact, the Beijing Capital International Airport has about 90 security entrance and it will open about 60-80 security entrance according the passengers traffic. This fact is very similar to our results and proves that the model we built is very reasonable and correct.
